  Austin&#8217;s biggest party is over, and real life begins again. This was my best <a href="http://www.sxsw.com" target="_blank">SXSW</a> experience yet, a well-rounded affair of movies, music, food and celebrities. What else is there?

I&#8217;m sure New York City offers the same amount of energy and entertainment on any given week, but to be in the middle of Texas and have the world pay you a visit . . . well, it&#8217;s special.

  For the second year in a row, I worked as a photographer for the festival, giving me access to all of the interactive and film offerings via the ubiquitous-but still coveted-badge. Over the course over the next few days, I&#8217;ll write about <a href="http://words.rodmachen.com/?p=535" target="_blank">What I Learned</a>, <a href="http://words.rodmachen.com/?p=535" target="_blank">What I Heard</a>, What I Saw, What I Ate and Who I Saw.
