Melanie Haupt&#8217;s <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/2014-02-07/harmonic-convergence/" target="_blank">recent review</a> of <a href="http://alcsteaks.com/" target="_blank">Austin Land and Cattle Company</a> in the Chronicle has convinced me to get back there and try their bar menu. I like the idea of a really nice restaurant also having a second more-affordable menu. When the prices get cut for Happy Hour (5-7 M-F), it gets even more appealing. A good $9 hamburger is fine, but for $4.50, it&#8217;s fantastic. The most enticing item on the menu is the steak sampler with 2 oz pieces of filet, sirloin and ribeye for $11 (9 HH.) That&#8217;s the equivalent of a small steak for <a href="http://www.stockadecompanies.com/ourrestaurants/sirloinstockade/" target="_blank">Sirloin Stockade</a> prices.

The high-end meals I&#8217;ve had a Austin Land and Cattle have always been great. Can&#8217;t wait to try the other side of their offerings. It probably won&#8217;t be long.
