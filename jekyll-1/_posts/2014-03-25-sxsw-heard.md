Music got short shrift this SXSW, and I can only count four bands among my adventures. My work as a photographer for the festival got me into Interactive and Film events, but not music. Still, I made one day show, one night gig and some corporate parties. Oh, and some street music like this sax player.

Back in the day, getting a wrist band was the SXSW thing for me and my friends. Nowadays, I&#8217;m not sure that even gets you in many places since there has been such a proliferation of badges. Day parties are doable, but even they are crowded nightmarish affairs for the most part. The one I found (All Tomorrows Tacos at the Lost Well) was old school: small club, several bands and no crowds. It was refreshing.

Kelly Deal (sister of Kim and former member of the Breeders) has a new group along side Mike Montgomery. I have nothing to say about the music, except that I was glad to have heard it. It&#8217;s good that she&#8217;s still making music.

**Tennis Pro<!-- <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-538" alt="Tennis Pro SXSW" src="http://words.rodmachen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Tennis-Pro-SXSW.jpg" width="720" height="480" /> -->**

This band can&#8217;t be separated from their movie Big In Japan. I saw both on the same night, and enjoyed each iteration in its turn. Tennis Pro plays fun music, and while it would be nice if all music deserved this modifier, in fact, most modern melodies take themselves much too seriously. Song titles such as &#8220;Don&#8217;t Play Purple Guitars,&#8221; &#8220;Freak in the Maid Bar,&#8221; and &#8220;The Man Who Fell Into the Rising Sun&#8221; these guys do indeed know how to have fun. I heard echoes of The Peenbeets, but with more straight-forward rock.

This Austin-based band is descended from 90&#8217;s proto-emo outfit Mineral. Upbeat and thoughtful.

**Doug Gillard<!-- <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-542" alt="Doug Gillard SXSW" src="http://words.rodmachen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Doug-Guillard-SXSW.jpg" width="720" height="480" /> -->**

Former Guided By Voices sideman played an acoustic set in the back of the Lost Well. Unamplified, this is a tough proposition. Doug soldiered through, and the audience enjoyed it. I guess that&#8217;s enough.
