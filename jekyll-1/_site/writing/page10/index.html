  This was an interesting year as an Aggie football fan. Not only was the season full of exciting (as well as heartbreaking) moments, but I wrote about all of it for the <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com" target="_blank">Austin Chronicle</a>. Having to be circumspect after each game was good, though after losses it was hard. Now that I&#8217;ve filed my <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/sports/2014-01-08/the-day-johnny-manziel-split-town-for-good/">last story of the year</a>, a look back on the high- and low-lights of the year is in order.

            <p>Hot dogs are one of those foods that can be extremely appetizing on television, beyond its intrinsic ordinariness. For instance, Anthony Bourdain can make some city’s version look like a meal worth getting on an airplane for. Heck, I’ve watched an entire hour on hot dogs around the United States. They all looked good.</p>

            <p>The GM Steakhouse occupies a special place in Austin’s nostalgic past for me. I knew of it before I moved here and ate there until it’s departure. It exemplified aspects of old Austin that don’t exist any more, while at the same time, it was romanticized beyond its reality. Much can be learned about the transition Austin has undergone–and continues to undergo–as we grow and grow and grow.</p>

            <p>Last stop on the Christmas-traditions joyride was <a href="http://www.balletaustin.org/" target="_blank">Ballet Austin’s</a> production of Tchaikovsky’s <a href="http://www.balletaustin.org/atb/nutcracker2013.php" target="_blank">The Nutcracker</a>. Our oldest can now sit through half of a church service, so we figured she was ready for the big time, and when it comes to kids, Christmas and classic music, The Nutcracker is the biggest of times.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.sho.com/sho/dexter/home" target="_blank">Dexter</a> might have had its moments as a television show, but it was never confused for a top-shelf parenting manual. However, not only did it share a brilliant piece of parental advice, but it came from a most unlikely of characters: the Trinity Killer. John Lithgow’s mass murderer might have had his problems (most of which Dexter Morgan solved for him), but he did have a pretty viable facade of domestic bliss, and heck, other than the abusive outbursts, he was probably a pretty decent dad.</p>
